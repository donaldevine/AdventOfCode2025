# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025

Solutions for [Advent of Code 2025](https://adventofcode.com/2025) challenges.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository contains solutions implemented in both **Python** and **TypeScript/React**.

### Solutions

| Day | Language | Files | Description |
|-----|----------|-------|-------------|
| **Day 2** | Python | `day2.py` | Invalid ID detection - identifies numbers with repeated patterns |
| **Day 3** | Python | `day3.py`, `day3_part2.py` | Joltage calculation - finds maximum joltage from battery banks |
| **Day 4** | TypeScript/React | `day4.tsx` | Forklift paper solver - grid-based puzzle with interactive UI |
| **Day 5** | TypeScript/React | `day5_part1.tsx`, `day5_part2.tsx` | Ingredient checker - validates IDs against range constraints |

## 🚀 Running the Solutions

### Python Solutions (Days 2-3)

```powershell
# Run Day 2
python day2.py

# Run Day 3
python day3.py
python day3_part2.py
```

### TypeScript/React Solutions (Days 4-5)

These are React components that can be integrated into a React application. They include:
- Interactive UI with file upload support
- Example inputs for testing
- Visual results display
- Support for both part 1 and part 2 of each day's challenge

To use these components, integrate them into a React app with the necessary dependencies:
- React 18+
- lucide-react (for icons)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x** - For algorithmic solutions
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React** - Interactive UI components
- **Lucide React** - Icon library

## 📝 Notes

Solutions are implemented as:
- **Standalone Python scripts** for computational challenges
- **Interactive React components** for visualization and user interaction
